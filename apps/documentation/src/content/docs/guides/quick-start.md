## 1. Install a powerup 

Powerups can be installed from either npm or git repos:

```sh
pup install npm:@liolocs/powerup-hello-world
```

Add `--local` to install into the project store instead of the global store,
and `--dry-run` to preview what would happen.

## 2. Use a powerup

Apply a powerup in a project, passing its variables as flags:

```sh
pup use powerup-hello-world
```

Add `--dry-run` to print the rendered output instead of writing files, and
`--target-dir` to run against a different directory.

Every `pup use` records what it wrote in `.powerups/manifest.jsonl` — the
applied manifest that powers diagnosis and repair workflows.

## 3. Remove a powerup

You can remove the powerup by using just the powerup name:

```sh
pup uninstall powerup-hello-world
```

or by using the full package source:

```sh
pup uninstall npm:@liolocs/powerup-hello-world
```

Like `install`, it removes from the global store unless you pass `--local`.
